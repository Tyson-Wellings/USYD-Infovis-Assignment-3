            <h1>Was Twitter's decision to banish Trump from their platform blatant censorship?</h1>
            <p>On Jan 6th 2021, supporters of 45th U.S president Donald Trump stormed the U.S Capitol.
                As members of congress met to recount the electoral votes, an angry mob of Trump supporters battled
                police officers
                guarding the Capitol. These police officers were eventually overwhelmed. The mob forcefully made its way
                into the
                Capitol causing the congress members to evacuate as they donned gas masks. Eventually the Capitol was
                cleared.
                5 people had lost their lives and 140 were injured. In the aftermath of the events twitter made a
                decision that
                some found controversial. On January 8th Twitter decided to officially banish Trump from their platform
                as they
                feared his further tweeting could incite more violence.

            Trump the Prolific Tweeter

        <p class="copy" id="first-point-copy">
            Trump’s term as president began on the the 20th of January 2017 and lasted until the 8th of January 2021,
            a total of 1449 days had elapsed. During Trump's presidency he had tweeted a total of 16717 times.
            This means that on average Trump was tweeting 11.53 times per day. However, in reality his use was a lot
            more sporadic.
            <br> <br>
            It is interesting to note that as the years go by Trump’s twitter usage increases. The largest peak of usage
            is
            during October-November which coincided with the commencement of the 2020 presidential election voting.
            During Trump’s presidency his Twitter following would grow from approximately 20 million followers all the
            way
            up to 88 millions followers before he was banned from the platform on the 8th of January 2021. Trump’s
            frequent
            use of Twitter helped him build up a cult-like following on the platform. In this article we will examine
            how
            Trump’s tweets helped to build a narrative that could eventually incite such extreme mob mentality as
            evident
            during the U.S Capitol Riots.

            Name Calling has been long used for years in propaganda as a way to put another party down, while the term
            propaganda has a very heavy connotation one can look at billboards and advertisements to see that name
            calling is still a common tactic used to market products.
            <br> <br>
            Below are word clusters created using complex learning algorithms. While not perfect they do group tweets
            into discernable clusters that in general do share some commonalities. The clusters in blue are tweets that
            in general build a narrative that the democrats (hence the use of blue) are corrupt and cannot be trusted,
            except for Trump and his associates of course. Blue clusters also include negative sentiments towards the
            media and other countries. You can consider these the tweets that contain a lot of name calling. The tweets
            in red are tweets that in general are Trump speaking positively towards members of the republic party or
            people who support his agenda. These red tweets also include tweets where Trump highlights the good he has
            achieved as president.The grey clusters are tweets that are more neutral with not as much loaded language.
            This has been done for every year of Trump’s presidency (with 2020 and 2021 combined). You can hover over
            the clusters to read some of these tweets.

            When looking through Trump’s tweets it is hard not to notice how much emotion he converys. His tweets lack
            the professional matter of fact tone that other politicians typically adopt on their social media. It is
            interesting to note the evolution of his twitter behavior. In 2017 there are alot of red tweets speaking
            idealistically of what he wants to achieve and what he has achieved in his first year as president. While
            there are still blue tweets the red dominate overall. In 2018-2019 the balance shifts in the favor of blue
            tweets until 2020 where the red tweets are sparse, at this point the majority of Trump’s tweets speak poorly
            of his opposition. Hover over the clusters to read some of the tweets. The groupings aren’t perfect and a
            lot of tweets are more of a red and blue hybrid in 2020 but it becomes very clear that the characteristics
            of Trump’s tweets have shifted over the years. This indiscriminate use of name calling is one way in which
            Trump’s twitter contributed to the events that transpired during the U.S Capitol Riots.

            So far we have established that Trump tweeted more as his presidency played out and he also began to talk
            about his opposition more and more. One could argue that this is to be expected from Trump when you consider
            he would have been going through another presidential campaign. When we analyze all of Trump’s blue tweets
            from 2020-2021 and create a tally of the vocabulary used we can begin to identify common storylines and
            tropes. Providing us a more nuanced understanding of the nature of Trump’s name calling and the narratives
            it creates.
            In total Trump’s tweets contained 25320 unique words. Let’s draw our attention to the top 253 words, which
            be the top 0.1% of words tweeted by Trump. Within this top 0.1% we can find the following words: Fake,
            radical, sleepy, corrupt and lamestream.

            When clicking through the different words a few common narratives emerge. The ‘Lamestream’ media is full of
            fake news. Joe Biden is lazy and unqualified to lead the U.S hence the moniker ‘sleepy’ Joe. The ‘radical’
            left controls the ‘Lamestream’ media, social media platforms and the democratic party as a whole. The media
            and democrats overall are ‘corrupt’. Ironically the fear mongering that Trump claimed the media used against
            him is actually the second way in which Trump’s tweets contributed to the events of the U.S Capitol Riots.

        <h1>Putting it all together</h1>
        <p class="copy">
            Through the exploration of the data presented we can see that Trump in his tweets used name calling, loaded
            language and repetition to create and reinforce ideas that directly bred distrust in the government
            (particularly those on the democratic side) and the traditional media. These same ideas created a narrative
            amongst Trump supporters that America’s only hope for continued prosperity was in Trump repeating as
            president. It is not surprising that his supporters, once realizing that Trump had lost the election, would
            behave in a way that as a collective led to the horrific events of the 2021 Capitol riots. Was twitter
            justified in the ban of Trump off the platform? I invite you to go back and explore the data provided to
            come up with an answer yourself.
